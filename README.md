This repository hosts the recruitment dashboard static site. The content that GitHub Pages serves lives in the `docs/` directory so that builds run without Jekyll processing. The `.nojekyll` file ensures the static assets are published without invoking the default GitHub Pages pipeline that expects SCSS sources.
